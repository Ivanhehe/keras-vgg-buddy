Keras VGG buddy
===============
Lends a hand in adding a trained VGG16 network to your [Keras](http://keras.io/) model.

Pre-trained model
-----------------
[Here's a download](
https://github.com/awentzonline/image-analogies/releases/download/v0.0.5/vgg16_weights.h5)
which contains only the convolutional layers of VGG16, cutting it down to 10% of the full size.
